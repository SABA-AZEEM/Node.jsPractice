The fs (file system) module in Node.js provides a way to work with the file system on your computer. It is a built-in module, which means you don't need to install any external dependencies to use it.
The fs (file system) module in Node.js provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for working with the file system:-
Synchronous methods are blocking, which means that the code execution will pause until the operation is complete. For example, if you use the fs.readFileSync() method to read a file synchronously, the code will not continue until the file has been read completely.
Asynchronous methods are non-blocking, which means that the code execution will continue immediately, and a callback function will be called when the operation is complete. For example, if you use the fs.readFile() method to read a file asynchronously, the code will continue executing, and the callback function will be called when the file has been read completely.
