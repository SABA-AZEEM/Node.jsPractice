By default, nodemon only watches for changes in files with the .js extension. However, it can be configured to watch for changes in other file types as well.

To configure nodemon to watch for changes in other file types, you can use the -e flag followed by a comma-separated list of file extensions. For example, to watch for changes in .js, .html, and .css files, you can use the following command:

nodemon -e js,html,css
